Description of the Rotation

Jackson Park Hospital caters to a diverse population of America including Caucasians, Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, indigenous, and inner-city populations. The experience is phenomenal. The pathology seen is diverse and workup and diagnostics/Rx the state of the art. Hospital rounds daily in the morning. Timings roughly Monday – Friday: 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. If students are interested, they can do Saturday hours as well. Once a week they have a choice to remain on call as well with the team on the floor. Times are subject to change as per the attending’s schedule. Outpatient clinics 1-2 times a week for roughly 4 hours. Rotating Medical Students at JPH will work closely with the Residents, Fellows, and the attending team in close coordination with each other.

Student Responsibilities

Students may also be required to attend didactics, lectures, and grand rounds at the JPH. While participating as a member of the team, you will learn to interact with diverse patients and perform detailed history taking and physical examination, check labs and notes on the patient.

The students will follow up on all patients under their care every day. They will also participate in discharge planning and execution.
