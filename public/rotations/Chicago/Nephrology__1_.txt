Description of the Rotation

Hospital rounds daily in the morning/ afternoon depending on the attendings schedule. Timings roughly Monday to Friday 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. If students are interested, they can do Saturday hours as well. Times are subject to change as per the attending’s schedule. You will round on in-patients on the floor or ICU patients with Internal Medicine problems and with ARF, CRF, and ESRD needing Dialysis, Acid-Base, and Fluid and electrolyte disorders. Attending CKD or Hypertension clinics may also be required of the students. Rotating Students will interact with the residents from the residency program in managing the patients, interact with the nurses to facilitate the care of the patient, and interact with other faculties and subspecialties in the overall care of the patient.

Students may also be required to attend didactics, lectures, and grand rounds. While participating as a member of the team, you will learn to interact with diverse patients and perform detailed history taking and physical examination, check labs and notes on the patient. Formulate a differential diagnosis and an assessment and treatment plan for each patient on service and allotted under the attending physician’s supervision and guidance. The students will follow up on all patients under their care every day. They will also participate in discharge planning and execution.

This is a unique learning experience for medical graduates who are committed to becoming effective, successful residents. This clinical initiative is designed to prepare foreign medical graduates (IMGs) for the US clinical environment by providing them with hands-on clinical experience. You will have the experience as a clinical learner under the supervision of a teaching attending physician. At the end of your rotation, you may request a performance-based letter of recommendation on Hospital letterhead.
