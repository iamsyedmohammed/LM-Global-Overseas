Student Responsibilities

Rotating Students will interact with the residents from the residency program in managing the patients, interact with the nurses to facilitate the care of the patient, and interact with other faculties and subspecialties in the overall care of the patient.

Students may also be required to attend didactics, lectures, and grand rounds. While participating as a member of the team, you will learn to interact with diverse patients and perform detailed history taking and physical examination, check labs and notes on the patient. Formulate a differential diagnosis and an assessment and treatment plan for each patient under the attending physician’s supervision and guidance. The students will follow up on all patients under their care every day. They will also participate in discharge planning and execution.
