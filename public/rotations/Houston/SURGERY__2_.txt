Description of the Rotation

The students will attend whatever surgeries are daily scheduled in the OR at the hospital. They will closely work with the CHIEF of Surgery every day. They will do the preop preparation and evaluation of patients on the floor daily. They will observe any bedside procedures of central line insertion as well. Medical students will observe and learn the surgical procedures being done at the center. Outpatient clinics 1-2 times a week for roughly 4 hours. Will participate in Surgery seminars, Morbidity and Mortality conferences.

Students may also be required to attend didactics, lectures, and grand rounds. While participating as a member of the team, you will learn to interact with diverse patients and perform detailed history taking and physical examination, check labs and notes on the patient. Formulate a differential diagnosis and an assessment and treatment plan for each patient under the attending physician’s supervision and guidance. The students will follow up on all patients under their care every day. They will also participate in discharge planning and execution.

This is a unique learning experience for medical graduates who are committed to becoming effective, successful residents. This clinical initiative is designed to prepare foreign medical graduates (IMGs) for the US clinical environment by providing them with hands-on clinical experience. You will have the experience as a clinical learner under the supervision of a teaching attending physician. At the end of your rotation, you may request a performance-based letter of recommendation on Hospital letterhead.
