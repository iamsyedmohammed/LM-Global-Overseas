The attending physicians will inform the students of the schedule at the beginning of the rotation. LOR OR SLOE CAN BE DONE.

Learning Experience

This is a unique learning experience for medical graduates who are committed to becoming effective, successful residents. You will see an array of patients with various disorders and learn their Rx and Mx. The hospital and clinic initiatives are designed to prepare foreign medical graduates (IMGs) for the USCSE by providing them with hands-on clinical experience. You will learn the United States Health Care system under the supervision of a teaching attending physician.

At the end of your 4-week rotation, the rotating student may request a performance-based letter of recommendation on Hospital letterhead. While participating as a member of the team, you will learn to interact with diverse patients and perform detailed history taking and physical examination, check labs and notes on the patient. Formulate a differential diagnosis and execute an Rx plan for each patient under the attending physician’s supervision and guidance. Students will also participate in discharge planning and execution.
